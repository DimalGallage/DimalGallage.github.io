### Why Hutt Agency Is Different
Most agencies either focus only on design or only on development. Hutt Agency does both — with a competitive edge:  

1. **Custom-Coded Expertise**  
   As former software engineers, we build complex features and integrations that go beyond Webflow or Framer’s native limits.  

2. **Design + Development in One Team**  
   We have an in-house design team ensuring every project has a strong creative foundation before development begins.  

3. **Specialized in Animations**  
   We don’t just make static websites — we create interactive experiences that engage and impress.  

4. **SEO + GEO Ready**  
   We integrate search engine optimization and the emerging practice of Generative Engine Optimization so your website is ready for both Google and AI-driven search.  

5. **Education & Aftercare**  
   Beyond delivery, we train your team to use and manage Webflow. Our goal is to empower you, not lock you in.  

6. **Performance-Oriented Builds**  
   Every project is designed to be fast, scalable, and conversion-focused.  

7. **Global Experience, Local Care**  
   We’ve worked with businesses across continents, blending global expertise with personal attention.
